<b> PDF-Image-Insertion-Tool </b>

  This program let's you insert an image (.png/.jpg/.jpeg) into a desired page of a .pdf file. You can chose the width and height (in pixels) of the to be pasted image aswell as the X and Y coordinates.
 The size aswell as the XY input are both in an endless loop, in order to make the navigation of the image easier. If you press ENTER for one of the settings (f.ex size), it takes the previous setting (can save time). You can exit the loop and save the file by entering ENTER for both the size and the XY coordinates.  
  
  <b> NOTE: </b> The origin (0,0) is at the upper left corner.
