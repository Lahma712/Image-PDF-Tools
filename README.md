<b> Image-Bleaching-Tool</b>

  This program is very useful for improving the quality of scanned documents. Often, one notices when documents have been scanned as the color of the paper is not completely white ( not (255,255,255) in RGB ). This program takes an image as an input and changes every pixel thats "nearly white" to a complete white ( (255,255,255) in RGB ) while preserving colors. This get's rid of the "scanned look/feel" and makes the document appear much cleaner in comparison.
  
<b> PDF-Image-Insertion-Tool </b>

  This program let's you insert an image (.png/.jpg/.jpeg) into a desired page of a .pdf file. You can chose the width and height (in       pixels) of the to be pasted image aswell as the X and Y coordinates.
 The size aswell as the XY input are both in an endless loop, in order to make the navigation of the image easier. If you press ENTER for one of the settings (f.ex size), it directly takes the last setting you entered (can save time). You can exit the loop and save the file by entering ENTER for both the size and the XY coordinates.
